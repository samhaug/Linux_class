# Linux_class

Output files of various instruments/programs used at Umich EES dept.
Example python scrips on how to analyze and plot results.
Learn how to analyze data and make publication-quality plots with python. Also
learn basic bash navigation and file manipulation. Work more efficiently.

Week 1: Intro to the terminal, basic bash commands, VI. Vimtutor, linuxjourney. No directory to work out of

Week 2: Intalling the Anaconda package together. Work out of lists\_and\_strings. Strings,lists,file parsing, ipython interpreter.

Week 3: Work out of gephen directory. Simple scatter plotting and parsing. Intro to matplotlib and numpy.

Week 4: Work out of xrd\_outptut. Multiple subplot figures. Parsing xrd output file. ax.fill\_between. Gaussian blur from the scipy library to find peaks.

Week 5: Work out of interp\_polyfit. Use webplotdigitizer to get data from display.pdf and reproduce. Use Polygon patches, text annotation, interp1d, and polyfit.

Week 6: Work out of twin\_axes. Reproduce Spencer's scatterplot and introduce axes twinning. make\_plot.py reproduces the figure as close as possible, sams\_version shows a different concept.
