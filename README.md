# Linux_class

Output files of various instruments/programs used at Umich EES dept.
Example python scrips on how to analyze and plot results.
Learn how to analyze data and make publication-quality plots with python. Also
learn basic bash navigation and file manipulation. Work more efficiently.

Week 1: Intro to the terminal, basic bash commands, VI. Vimtutor, linuxjourney. No directory to work out of. Print out vi cheat sheet for students.

Week 2: Intalling the Anaconda package together. Work out of lists\_and\_strings. Strings, lists, file parsing, iPython interpreter.

Week 3: Work out of gephen directory. Simple scatter plotting and parsing. Intro to matplotlib and numpy. Print out numpy and matplotlib cheat sheets for students.

Week 4: Work out of xrd\_outptut. Multiple subplot figures. Parsing xrd output file. ax.fill\_between. Gaussian blur from the scipy library to find peaks.

At this point, talk about the final project. Each student should make a directory similar to the excersises done so far. The goal is to use python to automate some mundane spreadsheet task or make a plot from data. Each directory needs to have a README explaining what the script does and how to use it. Also, each directory must contain the data needed to run the script. 

Week 5: Work out of interp\_polyfit. Use webplotdigitizer to get data from display.pdf and reproduce. Use Polygon patches, text annotation, interp1d, and polyfit. Print out list of matplotlib color codes. Introduce html color code website.

Week 6: Work out of twin\_axes. Reproduce Spencer's scatterplot and introduce axes twinning. make\_plot.py reproduces the figure as close as possible, sams\_version shows a different concept.

Week 7: Introduce the Pandas series object and how it relates to the 
dataframe object. Also loose ends with vimrc, bashrc, ipython startup,chmod. 
Work out of pandas\_intro and rc\_files. Print out pandas cheat sheet for students.

Week 8: Introduce and play around with the sympy library. Mostly for fun.
Work out of sympy directory. Use this class to reiterate object oriented programming.

Week 9: Spring break during the Spring semester. Move this week to accomodate thanksgiving break.

Week 10: Work out of colormap directory. colormaps and gridspec. Talk about advantages/disadvantages of different color maps.

Week 11: Basics of git and github. Use github to download vim-airline. Use github\_intro as a test folder for this.

Week 12: hdf5 and h5py. Data compression and organization.

Week 13: argparser. Making scripts readable and well documented for yourself and other users. Best practices.

Week 14: Modules and intro to Classes. Use mendeleev as an example. Possible neutron scattering?

Week 15: Back to bash! Explore advanced bash script techniques.

Week 16: Present your scripts to the class.
